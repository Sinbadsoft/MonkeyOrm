[assembly: AssemblyDescription(@"A small and powerful ORM that doesn't get in your way.
Features:
* Built-in CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete and Create-or-Update (aka Upsert); 
* Transactions; 
* Objects slicing on insertion with a black list or a white list; 
* Bulk-fetching; 
* Data streaming; 
* Batch insertion, with fine-grained control on number of inserted objects per query; 
* Blobbing; 
* No fancy DSL, only SQL;
* Stateless, no caching;
* Doesn't pollute your code: no base classes to inherit from, no attributes and no xml config;
* Easy to adopt, easy to get rid off: It's just your POCOs and plain old SQL;")]
